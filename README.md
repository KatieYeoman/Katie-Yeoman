Brief description of each file:

Compressors 25-03 multi is an Aspen simulation of the compressor in Node E. This file was used to obtain economic values as it relates to the multi-stage compressor.

Compressors 25-03 single is an Aspen simulation that was used to compare the economic costs of having a single compressor and having a multi-stage compressor.

ESP_20_03 is a MATLAB file showing the key variables and equations relating to the design of the ESP. This spreadsheet was used to optimise the design to meet the various constraints.

Heater 25-03 just one is an Aspen simulation of the heater in Node E. This file was used to compare the economic costs of having a single heater or multiple. 

Heater is the Aspen simulation that was used to obtain the economic costs for the heater in this node. The simulation contains 2 heaters, as was found to be optimal.

Node E economics is a spreadsheet used to compile all the economic values obtained by hand, or from Aspen.

Phase 2 cashflow contains the spreadsheet the group cashflow table was calculated using.
